1. Request data is not being validated instead it is being handled with if-else statements

  

2. **Lack of Error Handling:** The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. If an exception occurs during the execution of code, the error will not be handled properly, leading to potential issues or unexpected behavior in the application.

  

3. **Response Format:** The code returns the response without formatting it. It is generally a good practice to return a formatted JSON response with the appropriate status code and structure to improve readability and consistency.

  

4. **Accessing Authenticated User:** The code accesses the authenticated user directly from the request using $request->__authenticatedUser at some instances. It is not a standard Laravel approach. It is recommended to use Laravel's built-in authentication system (Auth::user()).

  

5. Functions and Variable names are not convenient and appropriate. For example, $cuser should be $user. Also, the variable naming convention is not consistent in some places it is camel-case while in others it is snake-case. I prefer camel-case for controller and repository variables and snake-case for request variables.

  

6. For accessing the database entities both Eloquent and Query Builder are used. It is a good approach to stick to one for code consistency until unless one gives a noticeable performance than the other in some scenarios.

  

7. Eloquent queries, are beginner-level, are not concise and often include unnecessary comparisons such as "=".

  

8. Mailer should have been used outside the repository. It violates the single responsibility pattern and also makes the repository cumbersome.

  

9. Boolean values should be compared and used as true or false but in many places they are being used as strings 'true' or 'false'. Similarly, Integer values should be compared and used as 0,1,2... but in many places, they are being used as strings '0', '1'.

  

10. For Mails and Logger queues could have been used to reduce the request response time.

  

11. **Environment Variable Usage:** The code uses env() to access environment variables (ADMIN_ROLE_ID and SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID). Instead of accessing the admin and super admin like this, they should have been defined in the User model.


12. **No comments:** I have not seen any comments neither in Controller nor in Repository that makes hard for new developer to understand the code especially the complex scenarios.


The BookingRepository.php file contains more than 2000 lines of code that I think could be shorten to few hundred lines. I did not have enough time to go through all of the functions of this file. I only touched the few ones that are being used by BookingController. But the issues I found were almost similar in all of the functions. With proper structure, logic and right use of eloquent queries the file would hardly goes to few hundred lines.

In light of above mentioned points, this code is terrible.
